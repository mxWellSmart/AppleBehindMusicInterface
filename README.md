# AppleBehindMusicInterface
Try to reproduce the interface of AppleMusic "Behind the songs" web page.
## Result
- The original site https://music.apple.com/us/curator/behind-the-songs/1554941247
- My version : https://mxwellsmart.github.io/AppleBehindMusicInterface/
### Why ?
Since I am an huge fan of Nile Rodgers (and THE CHIC) and I am in a mission to land a job in Web Development, I challenge myself to implement this 
mockup as an exercise in mode "DAYS", a.k.a, 
Do As You See . I found this practice very good to accelerate my Front End skills. As I was seeing the website I was trying to mimicate the layout and features of the website based on the knowledge that I had/have of HTML/CSS,SCSS and FlexBox.
Another thing that I had to use a lot was the Chrome
Dev Tools to understand the features of a given section of the webpage.

### Lesson learned
- Even tough that the website doesn't "look" complex ,by simple look to the code source or by pressing F12, we can see a different story.The page rendering depends heavily on json objects.
- Website with sidebar are very popular.They are used in WhatsApp(web app), Youtube and Twitter. So the knowledge used to build this mockup can be reuse.
- Consistence, consistence and consistence. I used the  B.E.M. (Block Element Modifier) notation in the SCSS styling and sometimes I found myself having issues in the right naming of nested blocks.
### Next Steps
Even though, I think that the final result resembles the original website. There is a lot to improve in my version. The slide feature was not implemented. The scrollbar feature looks good but is need more love to be similar  to the original one. The CSS class naming need to be review.
